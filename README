INSTRUCTIONS:

1) Load files with impedance information into the system (ZXX_4E.m, ZXY_4E.m, ZYX_4E.m, ZXX_4E.m).

2) Run script "Main Reframing.m".

Notes:
  - User must define variables such as: 
    p = error percentage
    nrealiz = number of realizations
    np = number of periods considered for every window
    
  - Is possible to select either norm L1 or L2, by comment/uncomment lines 29 or 30 in file BahrCrit_reframing.m
